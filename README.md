# Chat-Forum
Welcome to my chat forum! This repository basically serves as a place to communicate with me, or other users on the GitHub. Please keep this repository neat and nice! __**Click [here](https://github.com/Jeydin21/Chat-Forum/discussions) to go to the chat list!**__

The rules are stated below:

**1.** Do not spam posts. The conversation will be locked and your messages deleted, so please don't try and do that.

**2.** Heated discussions about any topic will result in the chat being locked for a period of time.

**3.** No mini-modding, because you guys can't even do anything .-.

**4.** No talking about any NSFW related topics.


We still reserve the right to punish you in any way needed even if you did not break a rule stated above.
